# sei-project-one tetris
This is my first project in General Assembly written with HTML and Javascript.

I was apprehensive at first to take tetris as it was supposedly one of the most difficult in terms of technicality. However, I am very glad I did now.

This was completed with no hard copying of code, a lil working grease, and a can-do attitude. I must admit that I did do some research into other iterations of tertis and what kind of logic they used. Some of the research may have been to my detriment as at first I tried using <canvas></canvas> but after a day of managing to get a grid, I realised my lack of knowledge with it hindered any further progress so I started again with a div grid.
